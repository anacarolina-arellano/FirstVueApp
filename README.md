####**Description of what the project does**
This is the final version of the Warehouse app that I developed during the term. It contains the UI, navigation, the four main roles of the project: the customer, the inventory manager, the shipping picker and the sales and retrieves data from the store. 

In order to achieve the goals of the app, I made use of Vuex's State, Actions, Mutations and Getters. I also created a local file that stored the information about the products in order to simulate the retrieval of data from an api.
